                        Characteristics:
                        One of the most popular cat breeds in the world, the British shorthair is appropriately named. They're active without being boisterous, they're affectionate without being cloying, and they're smart but don't feel the need to show off by figuring out how to open your refrigerator. British shorthair cats are easygoing and will treat everyone in the family (including dogs and other cats) like a good friend, especially if socialized as kittens.
                        This happy breed loves a good romp as much as a night stretched out in front of the television. British shorthairs are ambiverts: They thrive on attention, but also value personal space and may turn up their noses at being held or hugged too much.
