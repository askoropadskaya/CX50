                        The Maine Coon cat has existed in the U.S. since the 1800s and is considered the oldest native cat breed in the U.S. Rugged and solidly built, the Maine Coon cat is known for its massive size, shaggy coat, and large tufted ears reminiscent of a bobcat.

                        Characteristics: Said to be dog-like in disposition, the Maine Coon cat is intelligent, friendly, and gentle. Laid-back and self-assured, these cats tend to take everything in stride and are great playmates for gentle children. They can usually coexist peacefully with other household pets, including other cats and cat-friendly dogs.
                        Maine Coons are sociable and inquisitive, and can usually be found wherever the action is in the house, inserting themselves into every interesting situation. Talkative but not overly loud, they express themselves through a variety of soft and melodious meows, chirps, and trills. They are quite trainable cats and enjoy learning tricks, responding well to positive training methods and tasty food treats. Despite the old stereotype, Maine Coons often love water and may play in it, bathe in it, dip their food in it, and even swim.
