                        Characteristics:
Abyssinian cats are known for their elegant body, short hair, and intelligence. They’re also one of the oldest known breeds — although their exact origin is unknown. Whatever may be the case, it’s clear that these cats are the perfect companion for almost anyone due to their unusual loyalty.

Physically, this breed has an athletic, slender, and lean body with long, elegant legs. Their face starts narrow at the nose, getting wider as it reaches the top of the head, giving it a wedge-like, regal look. Their ears are unusually upright, and their eyes appear to be shaped like almonds — these can be either gold, green, or hazel when it comes to color.

The usual Abyssinian cat size oscillates between being medium and large, around 10 pounds. However, keep in mind that males are usually larger than females, as the latter generally fall short of nine pounds.

Color-wise, the Abyssinian breed has a lot of variety, but the coat is always ticked — meaning that the strands of hair have alternating bands of light and dark colors. Ranging from chocolate brown to dusty cream, their fur itself is soft and silky, despite the short hairs.
