Questions:

Which predictions, if any, proved incorrect as you increased the number of simulations?:
As I increased the number of simulations there appeared to be a 0.0% chance of winning for some countries.

Suppose you're charged a fee for each second of compute time your program uses.
After how many simulations would you call the predictions "good enough"?:
1000 simulations "good enough". After 1,000 simulations predictions not seem to be true.
